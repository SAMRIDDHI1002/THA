            <p>Ever the philosopher on matters of the heart, life and death, good and evil, 
                our favourite headmaster didn’t only dish out wisdom exclusively relevant to magical 
                folk; we could all learn a thing or two from Dumbledore’s wisest words.</p>

        <p>The Mirror of Erised is as classic as you can get in the Harry Potter fandom, 
            first appearing in <b><abbr title="Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone">HP1</abbr></b> when
             Harry looked in the mirror and saw his deceased parents. Dumbledore later informed him 
             that the Mirror showcased one's greatest desire, revealing that his own wish was a pair 
             of woolen socks. Fitting with the secrecy Dumbledore maintained around Harry, 
             <b><abbr title="J.K. Rowling">author</abbr></b> later revealed that, at that stage of his life, Dumbledore actually saw his 
             own family, especially his dead sister Ariana.
            Of course, your greatest wishes change as you grow, and as <b><abbr title="Crimes of Grindelwald">COG</abbr></b> confirmed, 
            Dumbledore longed for something else in the sequel's 1927 timeline. As seen in the film's 
            final trailer and elaborated in the movie, he desired his old relationship with Gellert 
            Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) the most. When looking in the Mirror, Dumbledore first saw 
            his and Grindelwald's younger selves agreeing to a blood oath, followed by an image of 
            Grindelwald in the film's present day.
